Several strategies can help resolve this issue:

1. **Check dependencies:** Ensure all your project dependencies are correctly installed and compatible. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to reinstall dependencies.  Check for any conflicting versions or unmet peer dependencies. 
2. **Clean the project:**  Remove the `node_modules` folder and the `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json` file. Then, reinstall the dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`. 
3. **Invalidate cache:** Expo's cache can sometimes cause problems. Try deleting the Expo cache directory.  The location varies by operating system.
4. **Check your code:**  Focus on sections of your code that may have recently been added or changed. Look for syntax errors, runtime errors, and any usage of unsupported libraries or APIs. 
5. **Restart system:** Sometimes a simple restart of your computer can resolve temporary glitches in the build process.
6. **Update Expo CLI:** Make sure your Expo CLI is up-to-date by running `expo upgrade`.
7. **Create a new project:** In some cases, the easiest solution may be to create a fresh Expo project and then gradually migrate your code into the new one, helping to identify problematic parts of your codebase.
