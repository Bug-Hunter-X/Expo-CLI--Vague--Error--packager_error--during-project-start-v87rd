This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the Expo CLI to start a React Native project. The error, "Error: packager_error", provides little diagnostic information.  The `bug.js` file shows a project setup that might trigger the error (though the exact trigger varies). `bugSolution.js` provides strategies to resolve the issue, including dependency checks and project cleanup.
